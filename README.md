This is dev on Unity Game Engine packages.

The 2 I am currently working on are the 
- BetterTyping
- 4DRendering

BetterTyping uses radial menus to speed up typing using controllers. The driving motivation for this is that typing in VR sucks and needs to be better

4DRendering renders the portion of 4d objects visible in a 3d space. Instead of defining the shapes mathematically, it uses the principle that passing a 4d object through a 3d hyperplane contains all the information in the object.
